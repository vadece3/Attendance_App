# Attendance_App

To run the project you need to install android studio and import the project. The work is still and can still be woked upon.

#USED:

- Android Studio 2.2
- XML
- Realm Database

#Short Description:

It is an Android app used to conduct attendance in any institute.

#FUNCTIONALITIES:

1-	Upload the list of all the students offering a particular course (the class list) -> The only constrain here is that the Google excel sheet should be arranged according to the apps format so that the app can easily import it.(The app gives a specification on that)

2-	View all students present in the added list and add a new student in the list if needed.

3-	Import a new class list to add to the already present class list (updating the existing class list with another class list).

4-	Take attendance-> Here the attendance can be taken per date and each attendance date is given a particular mark i.e today's attendance can be taken on 10 and tomorrow's attendance can be taken on 5 and so un.

5-	View the attendance statistics of each student in percentage. You can also modify a student`s presence status.

6-	View and share the attendance excel sheet with anybody through mail.

7-	View an attendance graph (ploted chart) for all students.
